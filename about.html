<p>My name is Joey Mason. I'm a software engineer based in Los Angeles and am currently serving as CTO of <a href="https://www.repostnetwork.com" target="_blank">Repost Network</a>. I hold a degree in Computer Science from <a href="http://www.csulb.edu/" target="_blank">California State University, Long Beach</a> and have previously worked as a software engineer at <a href="https://www.freedompop.com" target="_blank">FreedomPop</a> and <a href="http://www.directv.com" target="_blank">DirecTV</a>.</p>

<p>I'm currently working a lot with Java 8 and Spring 4, as well as MongoDB, AngularJS and Elastic Beanstalk. I'm most excited about AWS Lambda and the <a href="https://serverless.com/" target="_blank">Serverless Application Framework</a>. It's an exciting time to be a developer!</p>
